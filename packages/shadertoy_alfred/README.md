## Contributing

This is a unofficial [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com) alfred workflow. It is developed by best effort, in the motto of "Scratch your own itch!", meaning APIs that are meaningful for the author use cases.

If you would like to contribute with other parts of the API, feel free to make a Github [pull request](https://github.com/ivoleitao/shadertoy/pulls) as I'm always looking for contributions for:
* Tests
* Documentation
* New APIs

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ivoleitao/shadertoy/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) for ways to get started.
