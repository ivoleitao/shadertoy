      "There's a lot of going on. The best is you start by taking a look at the individual buffers with the prepared statements lines 227, 231, 232. In Buf D are a few cells updated from a 2D physics simulation with springs, and the sound curve analysis happens there too. I split three volume bands for bass, mid, and treble and hooked them to pull at the end of the sling. The beat detection is totally imperfect, intuitively stunted. Write values in Buf D lines 311-314,  read values in Buf A line 63, 64 and print them on the side scrolling graph with a bunch of other helper values...\nAsk me anything.",
