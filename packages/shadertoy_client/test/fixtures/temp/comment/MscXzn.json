      "@ollj a somewhat simpler version with no sliders & buffers was added, see https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/MtGGz1\nThe same logic remains, therefore it is still on the long side (most ice-related logic is found in main_render(), renderIce(), and MAT_apply(), other things are for normal map and for tracing different objects). Anyhow, bottom line is : the most important trick here is to walk the distance field in the opposite direction (sign flip) for refracted internal ray-marching, the apply some fog-like shading according to internal ray-marched distance.",
      "i want a version without buffer\/sliders for simplicity.",
      "I feel like I can feel the little puffs of ice frost.  Magnificent stuff.",
      "Nice work! Looks real :)",
      "i got a pun too; its freezing at 7 fps on old 32 bit hardware.",
      "Really cool, especially when playing with the cursors!",
      "So nICE!!!",
      "pretty cool",
      "Nice looking!",
      "pretty & looks very realistic :)",
      "Gorgeous example, and it's running much faster than I'd expect it to. Those sliders are pretty cool as well. :)"
