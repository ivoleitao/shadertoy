It's like perlin noise a bit, but within a jittered \n\/\/ grid like voronoi):\n\/\/\n\/\/ voronoise(x) = pattern(1,1,x)\n\/\/\n\/\/ Not sure what one would use this generalization for, because it's slightly slower \n\/\/ than perlin or voronoise (and certainly much slower than cell noise), and in the \n\/\/ end as a shading TD you just want one or another depending of the type of visual \n\/\/ features you are looking for, I can't see a blending being needed in real life.  \n\/\/ But well, if only for the math fun it was worth trying. And they say a bit of \n\/\/ mathturbation can be healthy anyway!\n\/\/\n\/\/ More info here: http:\/\/iquilezles.org\/www\/articles\/voronoise\/voronoise.htm\n\n\/\/ More Voronoi shaders:\n\/\/\n\/\/ Exact edges:  https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/ldl3W8\n\/\/ Hierarchical: https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/Xll3zX\n\/\/ Smooth:       https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/ldB3zc\n\/\/ Voronoise:    https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/Xd23Dh\n\n\nvec3 hash3( vec2 p )\n{\n    vec3 q = vec3( dot(p,vec2(127.1,311.7)), \n\t\t\t\t   dot(p,vec2(269.5,183.3)), \n\t\t\t\t   dot(p,vec2(419.2,371.9)) );\n\treturn fract(sin(q)*43758.5453);\n}\n\nfloat voronoise( in vec2 p, float u, float v )\n{\n\tfloat k = 1.0+63.0*pow(1.0-v,6.0);\n\n    vec2 i = floor(p);\n    vec2 f = fract(p);\n    \n\tvec2 a = vec2(0.0,0.0);\n    for( int y=-2; y<=2; y++ )\n    for( int x=-2; x<=2; x++ )\n    {\n        vec2  g = vec2( x, y );\n\t\tvec3  o = hash3( i + g )*vec3(u,u,1.0);\n\t\tvec2  d = g - f + o.xy;\n\t\tfloat w = pow( 1.0-smoothstep(0.0,1.414,length(d)), k );\n\t\ta += vec2(o.z*w,w);\n    }\n\t\n    return a.x\/a.y;\n}\n\nvoid mainImage( out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord )\n{\n\tvec2 uv = fragCoord \/ iResolution.xx;\n\n    vec2 p = 0.5 - 0.5*cos( iTime*vec2(1.0,0.5) );\n    \n\tif( iMouse.w>0.001 ) p = vec2(0.0,1.0) + vec2(1.0,-1.0)*iMouse.xy\/iResolution.xy;\n\t\n\tp = p*p*(3.0-2.0*p);\n\tp = p*p*(3.0-2.0*p);\n\tp = p*p*(3.0-2.0*p);\n\t\n\tfloat f = voronoise( 24.0*uv, p.x, p.y );\n\t\n\tfragColor = vec4( f, f, f, 1.0 );\n}",
