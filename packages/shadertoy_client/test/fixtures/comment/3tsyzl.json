    "so  lovely. quite looking like some real medical slice.\nMaybe ambiant occlusion could be stronger ?",
    "The temporal reprojection Is Great!",
    "Ah wow thanks so much for showing me that!! Will be looking in depth at it and trying to apply it :)",
    "( beside, maybe there is already some optimization saving calculation in most of the black area )",
    "this is a case where my adaptive sampling trick might help [url]https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/3ljfRG[\/url], but on a fractal shape this is potentially at many places, while the shader is already  a bit costly.\nStill, 40% of the pixels are black, and 6% are in flat colored areas, so we could save about half of extra over-sampling cost. Not so impressive, though.",
    "Love this :) I have a question, I set line 30 to this:\n\nconst vec4  kC = vec4(1,-0.4,-.4,.2);\n\nand on the thin parts there's some aliasing or something, does anyone know a way to avoid that?",
    "It looks like very tasty candy",
    "Just amazing. The 'traps' really make it work ...",
    "Very cool, could almost be a cut open organ.",
    ":love: Even without the realtime aspect, this is a beautiful example. If someone had have told me a few years ago that path tracing clean looking animated 3D fractals would be possible in a browser, I would have thought they were crazy. :) Even now, it's a rare achievement. I wasn't really interested in realtime path tracing until learning about temporal camera reprojection a while ago, since it amplifies image quality tenfold. To my knowledge, you're the only person to put up a usable example anywhere.",
    "'xactly :-)   ( but why human, specifically ? :-p )",
    "Nice but makes me think too much of that \"dissect the human body\" images :)",
    "very nice fractal ... original !!!!! .. nice job !!!!  :)\n.............\nmuy bonito fractal ... original !!!!! .. buen trabajo !!!!",
    "Super cool. The 'traps' really complete the shape.",
    "wow! juliavascular system ;-)"
