    "This is a really nice effect! I know it's not really the point of this shader, but in case anyone else wants more realistic godrays, you can add a threshold by changing line 109 to\n```\nvec4 s = texture(iChannel0, uv);\ncol += smoothstep(0.75, 0.85, length(s.xyz)) * s * weight;\n```",
    "I made a couple of slight changes in order to gamma correct the final image so as to smooth out the rays a little.\n\nFor anyone interested in experimenting with the effect, you could pretty much drop any scene into the \"Buf A\" tab, tweak the light offset, etc, in the \"Image\" tab, and it should work well enough.",
    "yep, now working. niiiice ! (and fast !)",
    "I'm going to take a close look at this code; thank you for the descriptive comments in the code!",
    "thanks for the documentation... will be nice to review slowly ;) ",
    "Awesome, and thanks for the shout-out in the comments and description :)",
    ":love:",
    "Nice effect! Looks expensive. :)",
    "It works now. Looks great!",
    "@Duke\nThanks heaps for finding that. I needed to have a think about it, but I think \"clamp\" needs to be in the form \"clamp(val, min, max),\" strictly in that order. Your suggestion doesn't violate that, whereas the way I originally had it did (max could dip below min)... I think. That's just a guess.\n\nAnyway, I made the change, and I'll try to rewrite it in a more intuitive way later. I needed to clamp the sinusoidal value in the first place to give the trace function a better chance to hone in on it.",
    "This is awesome. A cool way to use the light (death) rays...",
    "Even changing it to\nreturn (clamp(0., -1.1, n) + 1.1)\/1.1 + bump;\nmake it work. Looks like clamp on some browsers don't like negative value as first parametr.",
    "It still looks the same for me :( Changing string 34 to\nreturn (n + 1.1)\/1.1 + bump;\nmake it work.",
    "@Duke and Fabrice\nI appreciate the help, as I'm sure you each have better things to do. :) I changed the \"m\" function to \"map.\" I built this up from scratch using an old, small code template with short variable and function names. Perhaps it was a naming conflict thing.",
    "It seems the problem is in \"m\" function. When I change it to another noise functions it starts to work.",
    "the mix line 242 brings all the bg orange. strangely if I suppress the mix, the scene is quite dark, and if I reset to 64 line 78 it is black. ",
    "@Fabrice and Duke\nI'd defined \"FAR\" inside one of the functions, instead of globally. Now, it's global. I'm assuming some systems put it into global space anyway, whereas others don't. Does that change things?",
    "in bufA::78 if I down the 64 to 30 I see a kind of 3D cubic network in a dense semi-transparent pinky-orange haze.  (which probably dominates all at 64).",
    "Fantastic !",
    "if in main() I directly draw the content of bufA I just have a plein pilnky orange",
    "on linux, I just see a huge sun covering most of the screen.",
    "@Duke\nThanks for going through the trouble to post the image. However, it's difficult to fix errors without the ability to replicate them. The idea behind this is to render a basic scene into \"Buf A,\" read it in from the \"Image\" tab, then radial blur it. Pretty straight forward stuff.\n\nFrom what I can gather from the image, the lattice structure perhaps isn't showing up, then just the background is being blurred out? Out of curiosity, if you transcribe the scene from \"Buf A\" into the \"Image\" tab, then delete \"Buf A,\" does it render as a normal scene? I'm trying to figure out which tab is causing the problems.\n\nOn another note, on my older computer, IE refuses to render a lot of the stuff on Shadertoy these days, including this (instruction count, maybe), so I've given up trying to accommodate it.",
    "Cool",
    "OK on Win7 + Chrome here. Great effect, nice work.",
    "Very nice mashup!",
    "wow",
    "I think that it looks wrong on my Chrome and Firefox http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/131hBg3.jpg"
