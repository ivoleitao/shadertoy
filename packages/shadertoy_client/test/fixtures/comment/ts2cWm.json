      "Elegant!",
      "Thank you for let me know this :)",
      "super nice.\ntoo late haha, i was working on a version for reproduce this [url=https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CFAKY9vhueo\/]one[\/url]\nbut not finished at this moment, it is indeed long time to tune",
      "this is class! so stylish!",
      "Awesome! Good to see this shader again :)",
      "Superb. In my top 3 favourites of the competition.",
      "A couple of hours to place everything and sculpt the shadows.\n\nThe light source is spherical - it's the circular sun light from my previous works but adjusted to be at a point in space rather than pointing in a global direction. The solid angle of the light is the same regardless of distance so it's technically physically incorrect.\n\nThe rules of 4k Executable Graphics are\n- render a single static image\n- on any PC platform (Win\/macOS\/Linux)\n- with a maximum executable size of 4096 bytes\n- and a maximum render time of 30 seconds\n(see the bottom of [url=https:\/\/2020.revision-party.net\/competitions\/graphics-competitions]this page[\/url])",
      "\"manually placed the primitives and nudged them around\" (and this by the numbers +recompile, I guess): wow ! how long did it  take ?\n\nBTW I realize it means that there are no curve in the face silhouette, just polygonal smoothed by penombra. Efficient illusion !\n\nI don't get the shape of the light source: is it a cylinder ? \n\n\"Revision 2020 \/ 4k\": I don't find the technical rules on their website (and I'm not familiar with demo competitions): here there were no limit of duration or perf of base code, \"just\" the limit of size ? (size of binary, I guess: mean all people have to be on Windows, & have the same brand of GPU ? )",
      "While I was working on it, I embedded an image of a face outline and drew it as a semitransparent overlay.\nFrom there I manually placed the primitives and nudged them around to match the outline.",
      "I'm curious: how did you proceed to find the proper design ? try and error, or did you got some algorithm ? or easing design process ? ( or do you know tutos \/ design making of ) about it ?",
