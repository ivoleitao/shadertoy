      "Matt Gattis made a WebGL clone of Milkdrop: Milkshake https:\/\/github.com\/gattis\/milkshake It had an offline Python script to convert oldschool script-based effects to JavaScript but lacked shader support.\nJordan Berg (https:\/\/twitter.com\/jnberg16) has programmed a clone in Clojure that can translate even modern DX9 HLSL shaders to WebGL glsl, at runtime in the web browser. Check out https:\/\/butterchurnviz.com\/ The auto-translated shader code is not as readable as the original as you can imagine, but the proof-of-concept can convince. Butterchurn doesn't come with full-fledged online editors (yet), but it's still the best clone that I've seen. There's ProjectM for Linux and Mac, http:\/\/projectm.sourceforge.net\/ and the Syphon wrapper https:\/\/vdmx.vidvox.net\/blog\/projectmilksyphon for VDMX and other VJ software. ProjectM has a quirky blur implementation though. Many reaction-diffusion type presets suffer from that, I suppose. The same would be the case for this Shadertoy entry, so I rather re-implement old music visualization tricks from memory and give them a fresh new look. I have literally created thousands of *.milk files over the years. Here's one big, but not quite complete collection of mine: http:\/\/www.mediafire.com\/file\/50l3p82mjh8i5ss\/Flexi%27s_Mildrop_preset_collection.zip",
      "This is great news ! I ever wondered what happened to all that fantastic stuff from milkdrop an why nobody seems to remember an reuses it. Is it possible to convert the old milkdrop files to use it in ST ?"
