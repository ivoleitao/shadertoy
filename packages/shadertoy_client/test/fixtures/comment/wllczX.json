      "Urb Club Pro's 5 remixes:\n[url]https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/3s3fDB[\/url]\n[url]https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/3s3BDB[\/url]\n[url]https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/3d3fDB[\/url]\n[url]https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/Ws3fDB[\/url]\n[url]https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/3dcfDB[\/url]",
      "Beautiful and so realistic. Love the coloring too!",
      "I take care of these plants too. This shader is really realistic!\nI especially like the white, powdery part,\nand the part with the leaves squeezed together in the lower-left corner.\nSuper nice!",
      "So beautiful!",
      "Oh nice! Thank you blackle :) that looks good to me.",
      "I played with the hash function some more today and I found that you can replace the `cos(k)` in the FK define with `k*k\/7.` and it remains random and should be more consistent across cards C:",
      "@Fabrice: I've reduced the bounces which speeds it up a bit. Shader Minifier collapses it to around 7500 chars, Crinkler does the rest\n\n@blackle: Oh no, I hadn't thought about that! Thankfully the texturing holds up pretty well on the different cards I've tried it on.\n\n@cyberjax: Thank you for sharing that story <3 my father also had a few of these in his garden, however I only became interested in them recently when visiting Kew Gardens. Congrats on the port, I'd be interested to see the changes as I'm currently learning hlsl myself.\n\n@jorge: What is your plarform\/browser\/graphics card? does it compile at all?",
      "this shader ...... I can't watch it on my PC .... :(\n...........\neste shader...... no lo puedo mirar en mi PC.... :(\n",
      "I love this.  It reminds me of my late father.  When I was six years old, he took some of his favorite succulents from his garden and exhibited them at a county fair.  What I never told him was that my younger brother and I used to sneak in the garden and eat them.\n\nI just finished porting the code to hlsl to run on my DirectX app.  It was probably my most challenging Shadertoy port yet in terms of the glsl to hlsl gothca's.\n\nThank you so much for sharing :)",
      "Yes it's beautiful! - all I can do is make spheres! Textures are really nice, i want to touch it!",
      "compression is pretty amazing these days!\n\nalso I took a closer look at your code and I see you're using my hash function! just be warned that it won't produce the same output on all graphics cards due to differences in the cos implementations",
      "is this 11314 chars shader really compiles into less than 4k ? ",
      "very nice, but way too costly ( 0.5 to 1 fps at 640x360 here )",
      "is that any better now, pjkarlik?",
      "I'm getting some black pixels in the bigger plant mostly around the center. down to 14 fps.. pretty otherwise.. win10 8core i7 \/ gf rtx ",
      "so gorgeous",
      "wow!!! remember to water them, but not too often!"
