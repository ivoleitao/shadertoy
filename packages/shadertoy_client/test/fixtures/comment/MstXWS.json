    "@Shane I'm working on a (hopefully) seamless cubemap version of this sort of thing. Here's the 2D-packed 3D reaction-diffusion system btw: https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/MscXzS",
    "Pretty cool. I was going to raymarch the original, but just as a raised 2D surface on a back plane. For the sphere, I though it might be possible to wrap the diffusion process to make it tileable, then cube map the result, but I think that'd still show some surface seams. Tri-planar mapping might roughly work, but only bump mapped.\n\nThat leaves tileable 3D diffusion packed into a 2D texture, and so far, I've been feeling too lazy to try that. :) Having said that, Shadertoy user \"cornusammonis\" has a really nice example along those lines.",
    "There's a way to do this without visible distortion, but I don't know how. I'm pretty sure bugman123 knows!",
    "good 3d-spheremap use of the ice effect from last week. seam is hard to hide,spheremapping the buffer should be doable. is also not resolution independent.",
    "nice"
