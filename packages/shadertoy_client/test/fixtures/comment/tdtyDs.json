      "@dr2\nI'm not sure why it kills you Linux machine. If you look at the \"map\" function, you'll see that there's five texture reads, some hash calls, four extrusion calls, and a few other things. Not super quick, but my machine runs it with ease in the 800 by 450 window. This particular scene isn't fast enough for full screen, but I have a simplified version that does it with ease. I have noticed that not all machines enjoy reading from the cube map, so it could be that, but hardware isn't my specialty.\n\nAs for the algorithm itself: It's similar to standard rounded hexagonal Voronoi, which a bunch of us, including yourself, have utilized in various forms. However, it's fundamentally different in the sense that it's a geometric rendering of pixel perfect packed rounded hexagons with offset vertices -- as opposed to offset nodal points whereby nearest edges are calculated, which gives no access to vertex lists... if that makes any sense. In fact, I don't technically think this traversal is Voronoi... but don't quote me on that.\n\nThe other big difference is variable custom heights. Trust me, that adds an almost headache inducing level of annoyance, since everything needs to be wrapped then tapped four times over... or seven, in the case of hexagonal Voronoi. Anyway, I'm going to put up some examples later that show the benefits. And, as always, if you come up with improvements, which you often do, feel free to post them. :)",
      "Pretty. Kills my linux\/nvidia machine.\nI think my \"Desert Town\" is a simplified version of the same idea (traversing an extruded  hexagon-based Voronoi height field)?\nI will not be going to Bavaria in the near future (their beer doesn't provide viral protection). :)",
