    "no0b here, trying to figure out how to extract only the environment from this.  I would like to use the mountains and the sky as a dome, but I'm not exactly sure what to remove from this demo.  Everything seems to be linked.\n\nHelp?\n",

    "@alijaya That is what the buffers are for - they are rendered in the same way as Image, but can be accessed using samplers.",
    "@ttg: I mean, how you can keep the persistent data, like the roll and the pitch of the plane... If each frame is recalculated independently, it means, there's some data that can be transferred from previous frame to current frame ._. *I'm not sure if I ask the right question ._.",
    "@alijaya Data can be embedded in the shader source using GLSL const arrays.\nThat said, this shader and many others on Shadertoy do not use such arrays; instead, the routines needed for calculating the\nspecific geometry of the scene are hard-coded.",
    "hey can you tell me how to host the data with shader? ._.",
    "wow, amazing shader! ^^",
    "Super impressive. Well done sir!\n",
    "Impressive! Excellent! :)",
    "All is done with math. No 3D models used. :-)",
    "is there a tutorial on how toset this up? like where do you host \/ upload the 3d model files? and how shadertoy works?",
    "extra film, excellent",
    "Just want to tell that I\u00b4m currently working on a TOTAL rework of my lighthouse. Have made some real progress the last days. I will be happy to show you when I\u00b4m happy with all the details. \n\nMeanwhile, if someone is interested, I would like to show you how I draw in a real 3D program (3DS MAX):\n\n[url]https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/FOOJKxJ.jpg[\/url]\n[url]https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/N2MLBKT.jpg[\/url]\n[url]https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ZGOrWBW.png[\/url]\n\nThat is the block I grew up in. Somewhat of a paradise to me.",
    "To hear all nice comments from skilled artists like you, really make my day. :)",
    "You've done it. You made the coolest shader.",
    "Amazing work on many levels! Congrats!",
    "Finaly! a well deserved star.",
    "Thanks Phi, glad to hear that!\n\nAlso thanks to admin to allow this shader to be the shader of the week. Much appreciated. :)",
    "Very beautiful shader !",
    "Note that the counters used for animation ought to have iTimeDelta multiplied by their steps, otherwise the animation fails to\nrun in real time when FPS is below 60.0.",
    "Not a bug: Interaction causes new frames to render, but does not advance iTime.  Since this shader implements its own\ncounter for animation, animation time can pass due to interaction even when the shader is paused.\n\nThis functionality of rendering only upon interaction is very nice for working with interactive renderings\nwhich change with mouse and keyboard controlled parameters but not with time, since the shader may be kept open in the\nbrowser in a fully functioning state while not wasting GPU cycles when idle.  The feature also makes it possible to pause an animation at a specific moment in time and interactively adjust parameters without advancing the tim.\n\nThat said, the feature has no use to viewers of an animation shader such as this one.",
    "clicking tabs or moving the cursor while holding down left mouse button triggers the shader to do one update step each time on move mouse event.",
    "More likely a bug in shadertoy itself, who knows.",
    "@ w23 and morgan3d\nThank you guys.\n\n@bit2shift\nIt\u00b4s the way shaderToy works. ;-)",
    "Very impressive!",
    "bug: when the time is stopped, the plane moves when you click the buffer tabs or drag the camera around.",
    "A beautifully crafted shader! The attention to detail with moving parts, explosions, and fine tuning is amazing.",
    "@ \tGregRostami\nWell, I would really like to see that artifact myself. Very hard for me to solve otherwise. There are NO lens flares for missiles, just a simple raymarch distance check:\n\n      \/\/ calculate engine flare\n      float lightDist = TraceEngineFlare(rayOrigin, rayDir, missile);\n\n      \/\/ add engine flares for missiles based on engine distance\n      vec3 lightFlares=vec3(0.);\n      lightFlares =  mix((vec3(1., 0.4, 0.2)), vec3(0.), smoothstep(0., 1.1, lightDist));             \n      lightFlares =  mix(lightFlares+(2.*vec3(1., 0.5, 0.2)), lightFlares, smoothstep(0., 0.7, lightDist));\n      lightFlares =  mix(lightFlares+vec3(1., 1., 1.), lightFlares, smoothstep(0., 0.2, lightDist));\n\n\n\n@ \tDave_Hoskins\nYou know... you just solved a very irritating bug I had. Thanks buddy. I\u00b4ve now made the changes. :)\n\n",
    "Thank you for fixing the fun flare. The missile flare problem is still there. Toggling the 5 keys doesn't fix the problem.",
    "very good cloud occlusion , flare, glare , glow, hdr stuff.\nmany good approximations mixed together to a good illusion.\n\nillusion mostly breaks at high altitude vehicle, where clouds change shape depending on camera position being above or below the vehicle, is confusing. slightly less confusing for a first person perspective.\n\ncamera below ground still renders the vehicle. \n\nboth of these are stretching the boundaries of this anyways.",
    "Be aware that flying upside down has an inverted tilt direction for the missiles...",
    "If you only knew how happy I am you like the effort I put into this. \nThanks for all kind words, means a lot to me. :)\nYou guys are the best!",
    ":love: I get tired just thinking about the amount of work that went into this. Truly awesome.",
    "damn! unfortunately shadertoy is experiencing some CSS errors or you'd have one more <3",
    "holy crap. That's a lot of effort!",
    "@Observer & GregRostami\n\nCome to think about one thing. Did you by accident turn on the lens dirt filter? That would cause that noise all over the screen when staring into the sun and flares.",
    "Added option to enable\/disable lens flares with 5-key.\n\nBtw. did anyone notice that the rudders actually move when turning (W and R keys) and pitching?",
    "Explosion impact compare. Berfore \/ after:\n\n[img]https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/TQB5a9D.png[\/img]",
    "Huge thanks to all of you. \n\n@Observer & GregRostami\nChanges made, hope it displays right for you now. I don\u00b4t have that problem myself, sounds weird.",
    "Very nice!",
    "Changing line 123 to vec3 flareColor=vec3(0); did solve the sun problem, but the missile flares are still broken.\n",
    "On my MacBook Pro there are artifacts in the sun glow and the glow from the missiles.",
    "OMG!! AMAZING!",
    "Very realistic an beautiful!\nI only have an issue with the CalculateSunFlare-function, it produces a bright white circle (almost the size of the view) with noise. I can solve it by initializing flareColor in line 123 with vec3(0.0).",
    "Well worth the cloud system change! Very cool.",
    "Nice, now we are talking, glad you worked on the lighting. Really excellent!",
    "awesome!!",
    "Nice one, looking great!",
    "omg",
    "Thanks! I\u00b4m very happy to hear you like it.",
