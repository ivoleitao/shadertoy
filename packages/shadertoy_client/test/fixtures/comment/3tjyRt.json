      "@asneakyfatcat Hmm - song is playing for me.. but sometimes you have to stop, rewind the shader and start again.. it's weird.\nYeah I should optimize this - its a few months old and I've learned so much more now! ",
      "Heads up, the link for the soundcloud song doesn't seem to work for me through shadertoy, though other songs play fine if I change the url. \n\nPretty cool shader, though the tiling implementation runs very slow on my laptop, to the point where turning off shadows \/ reflections \/ limiting raymarching steps only net me a few extra fps. I'm going to need to check this out when I'm back on the desktop.",
      "@BizKwikTwist -> [url]https:\/\/thebookofshaders.com\/[\/url] is the best place to star that journey. Also search youtube for The Art of Code @BigWIngs on here, does some good tutorials on 2d and 3D shaders.",
      "This is so cool, any tips for someone on the journey to make basic shaders?",

      "@dean_the_coder - thank you! I'm actually pretty honored, but it's just everything I've learned from you all guys - that are actually good at this! ",
      "@pjkarlik Shader Of The Week!  Congrats!",
      "if you swap the music line #60 is the adjustment (sample phase) .0020 - .0740 depending on range\/frequency in music.",
      "nice",
      "@Shane - speeds is always an issue. I code on a big gaming PC... but  I have a old MacBook I use as a baseline (and it dies on this). I definitely need to understand these tricks for optimization.. I see Fabrice golf but just get lost trying to unravel that energy! But this shader was more playing, less planning.. I think now it's going to be my Optimization self test! \n\n@iq thank you! Mostly tricks from both you two!",
      "Nice. I need to put more sound based stuff together at some stage.\n\nI use that particular routine for various extruded tilings on the 2D plane. By changing the initial block centers, rendering different shapes, etc, you can do a lot with it. Of course, if you know what particular setup you're coding, then you can streamline things considerably. With squares and hexagons, you can store two faces in a vec4 and group operations, etc. For instance, the \"floor\" calls would get cut in half, and so forth. However, if speed isn't an issue, I'm usually happy to leave it in its current form.",
