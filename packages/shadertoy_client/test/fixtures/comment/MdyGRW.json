      "Cool!",
      "Very nice!!",
      "Man this is awesome, I feel like in an Alien movie - love the music too!",
      "@eiffie, oh of course. I've put that in and I think I'm getting away with the simpler version. :)\nIt does mean the lack of blurring shows up the aliasing a bit more, but it is clearer.\nCheers.",
      "Atmospheric, super pretty, and your code is always easy to read through.",
      "DOF is trickier than it seems. For instance on distance objects you don't want to pull in samples from nearer pixels that are in focus. (That gives the sharp focused areas jitter around the edges.) The opposite would be true if near items are out of focus - then you WANT to pull in samples from these areas even if your pixel is in focus. Yikes! But this is very pretty. :)",
      "wow !",
      "I'm using the arrow keys already, if you want to try them.",
      "Dave: no, please avoid \"key cursors\" like WASD : on non-qwerty keyboard it can be very unconvenient. Arrows keycode are easy to find. or the numeric keypad (but not everybody have one).",
      "Aren't fractals magnificent. Even BBM would be impressed.",
      "You should add VR support :)",
      "This is beautiful dude.",
      "Mouse drag to turn, ie. you can let go and regrab. WASD or Cursor keys to move. Space or Shift to speed up."
