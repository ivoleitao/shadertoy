    "Awesome tutorial. Thank you!!",
    "Huh, maybe Firefox cached the old Shadertoy code?  Pol said something about that, but it surprised me, since Firefox seems to download the latest scripts every time a Shadertoy page loads.  Oh well, thanks for fixing it.",
    "Weird, the mouse is working fine in Firefox but not Chrome! Annoying. I removed the iMouse.z reference and it seems to work now.",
    "Thanks!  Mouse buttons still aren't working though.  I don't follow exactly why you check both .z and .w for iMouse in multiple places, but now to detect button rising edge, ( iMouse.w > 0. ) is sufficient.",
    "Thanks, I've fixed it now.",
    "Shadertoy's 'void main' has been moved from footer to header, so '#define mainImage' no longer works as it did.\n\nCompletely unrelated to the above, but the whole tutorial-area could be wrapped in hidden '#define mainImage _mainImage' \/ '#undef mainImage' to allow mainImage to be written by the tutorial user in the normal way.\n\nAlso, the buttons have stopped working since Shadertoy devs recently made a breaking change to iMouse.zw behavior: [url]https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/Mss3zH[\/url]",
    "Thank you for creating this, I now understand how raymarching works!",
    "1 frame per second on intel 530.",
    "That's wonderful! I'm so glad I could help! :)",
    "Thank you! I now understand SDF & ray marching and have been working on some scenes of my own :) I've written pixel shaders before but the lack of geometry and a vert pipeline had been stopping me doing 3D in Shadertoy, but now with SDF and raymarching I'm having a bunch of fun. Thank you very much.",
    "OMG! This just incredible! :love:",
    "Wow never knew it was this simple to do sphere tracing. I was about to try out weird algorithms :\\",
    "Great idea and nicely done!",
    "I'm so glad! Obviously I'd like to win the competition, but I wrote this shader hoping that it might help bring people into the world of shader-writing!",
    "Also, after weeks and weeks of reading about ray-marching signed distance fields, this tutorial FINALLY made it click for me. THANK YOU",
    "O.O beautiful!!!",
    "If you switch to the Buf A tab you can copy and paste from the code in the comment there. But really you're supposed to copy all the code by hand so you learn it better! :D",
    "How do I copy and paste from the shader? :D",
    "The term \"quine\" comes to mind. Neat :)",
    "NB: this trick has been intensively used during the last month ;-) . Note that I don't think it is compulsory here. Just saving chars.",
    "Oh, thanks for catching that! Easily fixed. I wrote a Javascript utility to parse a text file - including some special characters for text colouring etc. - so it only takes a few seconds to fix typos!",
    "Great explanation and diagrams! And a LOT of text.\nI hope it doesn't muck up your tables too much, but on page two you've missed the 'e' off 'sphere'.",
    "omg! i like very much the way you used the #define mainImage() trick!! genius!!!",
    "haha, this is amazing!"
