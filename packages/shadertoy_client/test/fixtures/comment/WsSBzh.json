    "I was not very clear on what i mean.  The explanation on YouTube makes it real for me: the calculations, the seperate steps.. knowing how\/why\/what.       When i open this shader, from this shadertoy page, fullscreen at 4K,  then the quality reveals a lot more details (than from the default 840x472 view).  Obvious even without wearing my glasses.  My videocard is excited too then.        AA set to 2 makes especially the dreads look better.            You are quite skillful in your presentations. It inspires people, because your explanations make it sound so \"simple\".      Gracias",
    "Thanks! The Youtube video is 1080p, not 4k. But I think I know what you mean, I believe you are reacting to the high quality, antialiased and motion blurred rendering, which makes it feel \"realistic\".",
