        "@xiewei: well, on shadertoy there is also Doom, an Apple I emulator, and many games...",
        "wow,Is this still a shader?",
        "It's so cool",
        "wh",
        "awe",
        "That is freaking insane.  I love it!",
        "wow, really awesome!!!",
        "This is insanly cool. :-D",
        "Excellent",
        "Just can't believe ",
        "Why we tend to click the screen?",
        "Great!",
        "that amazing,can't believe it",
        "Good god.  This is just amazing!",
        "You just did your own textures... Dude..",
        "wow, just wow.",
        "This made my day. Did you generate some of this code?",
        "loooove it!",
        "Scary part is when you take a look at size of the code. Impressive",
        "Just AWESOME!!!",
        "I take 'shader update' to be the point where the animation resumes after the pause that starts when I press play, \">\", or ALT+Enter  By that measure, adding a blank line in Image after 1425 and pressing play shows the compile time is sometimes <~1s and otherwise ~3s.  Pressing instead ALT+Enter shows the compile time is always <~1s. This is on Windows 7 Chrome.",
        "After first load shader will be cached. In order to measure compile time, change something (e.g. add a blank line) and then count the time between pressing play and shader update.",
        "Image compile time is <1s here - 3.5GHz quad-core Intel. How can one measure the complete compile time accurately?",
        "Image compile time is <1s here - 3.5GHz quad-core Intel. How can one measure the complete compile time accurately?",
        "it took me the entire time to realize that I wasn't controlling the jumps by clicking.",
        "It won't be pixel perfect unless you implement Mario's gravity system: on falling slope gravity is 3 times higher - lack of it is immediately visible.",
        "Oooh man ! :-)\n\nI thought all competitors were already showing their work, but you're right, there might be a dozen secret projects currently out of the radar :-)",
        "I didn't add tag \"game\", because IMHO this tag is more suited for real interactive games (with multi-pass). \n\nI spend a lot of time making this shader (~100-150h), as it was my first Shadertoy and I had to learn a lot of stuff and I wanted to make everything pixel perfect to the original Mario. Music and sound part was very hard to make and took a lot of time, as I didn't know anything about that and have no talent for music. But, hey! I'm a seasoned game developer with countless crunches under my belt and this thing was quite fun to make.\n\nYes, it's not far from a game and it would be fairy easy to make a nice [SH16C] entry from it, but that would be too easy. So I'm cooking something more crazy for the [SH16C] :).",
        "I know what you mean. Even with the sprite data automatically produced it's a bit of a nightmare.",
        "BTW, I'm curious: how many time one spends to develop such a 48000 chars shader ???",
        "Oh you're right, I just got a look at several of them and did not noticed. oops.\n\n( but with all the work behind, is there really far to a working game ? the most tedious is the art, I guess you already have some objects engine, etc. )",
        "It's not playable though, so a 'game' tag wouldn't be quite right?",
        "you should add the tag \"game\" ! \n\nNB: several new ones thanks to [SH16C] competition :-) [url]https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/results?query=%5BSH16C%5D[\/url]",
        "Hold down the mouse button near the top of the screen to make Mario jump higher at the end flag, once you change line 1315 :-)\n    marioJumpAmplitude\t= iMouse.y * 0.5; \/\/ 76.0 * 0.45\n",
        "*kabooooom* ..... Mind. Blown.",
        "Unfortunately, there is no multi-pass for sound, so it's not possible to run SFX at moments defined by user's input. On the other hand, now I can implement proper CRT post processing (with blur etc).",
        "now  (and not no) i would say :)",
        "no with multipass its time to do a real game :)",
        "Wow!",
        "not playable on sahdertoy, because you must saved state of some vars, but on a dedicated webgl content outside of shadertoy it will be possible indeed",
        "Good!",
        "Thanks! I don't think I can make it playable as Shadertoys are stateless.",
        "wow! could you make this playable somehow?",
        "wow, now it's complete! 60fps on my slow gpu ... perfect!",
        "Completely stunning :)\n\nIt sounds like the sound is all an octave too low, though..? Is it just me?",
        "Yes!!!! Love the new flagpoint end!",
        "Thanks! I just added did some small tweaks: added flagpoint end, tweaked coin speed, added some flag interaction and a raising castle flag at the end.",
        "!!!\nThat is all.",
        "It works perfectly on my Mac now.\nWhat an incredible shader!! Congratulations.",
        "Wow! this is awesome! ^^",
        "OMG this is so crazy! 37128 chars!\nGood job! The shadertoy competition will be really interesting!",
        "this is completely insane and awesome!!!",
        "I've optimized compilation times. Initial version was compiling ~10s on my PC and now it's down to 3s. I don't think I can optimize significantly more without obfuscating code by expanding all conditions using an offline pre-processing step.",
        "took ages to load\/compile but well worth the wait :D",
        "It's a great work!\namazing!\n\n(my browsers crashed if i open the shadertoy website,\nbut Open alone is ok!)",
        "@GregRostami Which GPU does this Macbook Pro have?\n@aiekick Yes there should be some interaction. It's a popular demand, so maybe I'll add it later.\n@coyote Thanks! Sadly I don't have access to any Mac, so I couldn't test on it. I added this fix of yours. I'm also working on compilation time improvements. It would make my life easier if Shadertoy could display compilation time somewhere. Now I have to profile using a stopwatch :).",
        "Now, that's a lot of work! :love: it!",
        "Wow, amazing! :)",
        "it totally hang my linux\/chrome browser and almost even the whole window manager, as soon as the iconic view: it makes shadertoy home page a dangerous trap. solve urgently !  :-(",
        "Excellent!!! :love:\nJust one small thing... Initialise \"float ret=0.;\" in sound program. Otherwise sound is corrupted on mac.\nBtw, works on mac mini with iris and chrome in 60 fps with sound.\nSafari is very slow, about 3 fps, until I click on the close at the sound tab. Sound tab doesn't disappear, but the image shader is working in 60 fps then. (Although, I must admit, sound is not working in any shader in Safari on my computer. Don't know why...)\nBtw, compiling of your shader takes about 15 seconds for me. Among the longest of any shader I've tried here! It seems that I'll have to deactivate live previews again... :(",
        "but nice :)",
        "at the end there is no interact betweend the flag and mario ? it was not in the orginal ?",
        "That's insane. The only way to top that is to ray march it. :P",
        "It crashes my browser. Macbook Pro, crashes on both Chrome and Safari.",
        "Very, very nice!",
        "Pretty amazing!"
