      "Hi, I have a YouTube channel, I talk about space there, can I use this as part of a video?",
      "Beautiful.",
      "For those of you who, like me, just came here for a nice bloom algorithm, you'll find the bicubic interpolation code offered by this SO post (https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/a\/42179924\/899347 masterxilo's answer) to be better for the general case than the one used in the Image buffer on this shader. It's pretty hard to see the difference on Gargantua, but if you head over to https:\/\/www.shadertoy.com\/view\/XtKfRV (which took the same bloom algorithm) there are block-like artifacts that can be very apparent. Happy blooming and thanks to sonicether for such an awesome shader.",
