    "amazing",
    "maybe if you add one sideways fractal to make it look like evergreen forests.",
    "Yes, comments.  I wish people would document their work so that others could learn from it.  This shader is amazing, but it might as well be a Youtube video with respect to educational purposes - if you already know how to do this, you don't need to know how to do this!\n",
    "Nice work! If you have the time... some inline comments to walk us through the reason behind some of the math would be a great read for us :D",
    "Stunning, just love how the clouds makes shadows on the trees\/lakes. And the sunglare on the water...impressive. Fantastic composed and coded.",
    "Amazing!",
    "Excellent! :)",
    "More than fur, is like my old volumetric cloud shader but with only one octave of noise (and compressed horizontally). Which looks like fur of course! I have some grass experiments too with more complex mappings than just planar, it looks cool too :)",
    "oh god this is so awesome.",
    "Love it",
    "beautiful composition, as always! looks like my fur shader mapped to a plane :)",
    "Thx Dave. In fact, the noise is a bug. Mipmapping should be kicking in, producing the expected smooth reflections. In fact, depending on random variatons of the shader, sometimes is works as expected, which makes me believe this is a bug. I've isolated it to a very small repro case, I'm thinking of filing it as a bug to Angle\/Chrome...",
    "Wow! Has a very nice atmosphere.",
    "Perfect colours, and perfect shadows! Nice one, the tree height variation makes appear very real. Perhaps the lake's specular noise is not needed?",
    "beautiful scenery."
