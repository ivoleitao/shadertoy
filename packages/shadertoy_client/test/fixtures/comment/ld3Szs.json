      "@BigWIngs\nMy main focus here was the cheap 3D Voronoi-like implementation. At the time, raymarching 3D Voronoi wasn't viable, so I was obsessed with coming up with an alternative. I later went to the trouble of packing real 3D Voronoi into a 2D texture for a comparison. The real thing is better, but this is a way, way faster.\n\nAnyway, the rest was an afterthought, including the rendering style. Out of sheer boredom, I put up a \"Glowing Blocks\" example the other day and noted that it had a halfway decent heated surface look about it for very little extra cost. I think between that, this and few other things, it'd be possible to make a cheap, but nice molten rock example... Of course, if you want something really nice looking, then Virgil's \"Rhodium Liquid Carbon\" example would be the one to look at.",
      "This looks so cool! I've been wanting to make a lava shader for a while. Might see if I can use some of this somehow.",

      "Color are beautifull and the shader isvery fast even with this very very slow PC",
      "It looks very good :)",
      "Thanks for the comments. The cheap, cellular looking surface was the main point of this, but I also wanted an excuse to use XT95's really cool, cheap translucency code.\n\nBy the way, if anyone can figure out a way to reduce the instruction count in the \"cellTile\" function, feel free to let me know about it.\n\n@dila\nObviously, you'd be familiar with some of the distance function setup, but the cheap, volumetric fog might be of use to you, so feel free to use it, improve on it, etc.",
      "@tomkh\nIt hardly surprises me that you were thinking along similar lines over a decade ago. :)\n\nAs you'd know, repeat 3D Voronoi tiling, or any other 3D tiling, becomes trivial with 3D texture support, since you have the benefit of preconstruction - On a side note, I hear we'll be getting those at some stage.\n\nWhat makes this particular version interesting, to me at least, is the minimal instruction count. The tile here uses just six strategically placed spheres, and under certain circumstances, you can get away with as few as four. Of course, you're not limited to just spheres.\n\nI know of a few ways to take the method further, but I'd be more interested in seeing your take on it.",
      "_that_ is really cool",
      "Niiice.\nReminds me of things I was doing in 2003-2005 (also with 3d cellular tiles). \nUnfortunately, there was not enough GPU power to push things like this in real-time.\nAdditionally, your shader is (as usual) rendering fast & smooth. That's a big plus and rare trademark! :)",
