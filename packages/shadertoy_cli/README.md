## Contributing

This is the unofficial [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com) command line tool. It is developed by best effort, in the motto of "Scratch your own itch!", meaning APIs that are meaningful for the author use cases.

If you would like to contribute with new features, feel free to make a Github [pull request](https://github.com/ivoleitao/shadertoy/pulls) as I'm always looking for contributions for:
* Tests
* Documentation
* New commands
